# has, and -W fails the build. Six is every level markdown heads at,
# which makes the number a fixed point rather than one re-derived from
# files that move: section 2 of the organization's standard says so, and
# names a depth read off this tree's own headings as the rejected
# alternative. Part of what such a

# the noise, because what myst emits for a target it cannot resolve is not
# a visibly broken link, it is an anchor to an id the page does not have

# furo: content first, the navigation in the left sidebar and the page's
# own contents in the right, light and dark from one setting -- the shape
# a reference generated from docstrings has. Section 2 of the
# organization's standard is where it was weighed against shibuya, whose
# landing pages and announcement bars are surface this tree would carry
# and not use; sphinx_rtd_theme is where a Read the Docs project starts by
# default, which is a reason to find it in a tree rather than to keep it
html_theme = "furo"

# no html_static_path: this project overrides no stylesheet and ships no
# image, so the "_static" the sphinx template declares names a directory
# that does not exist, and sphinx warns about it on every build, which -W
# turns into a failure. The setting arrives with the directory, not before
# it


# -- Links out of the included root markdown files ----------------------------

# Some pages of the toctree are this repository's root markdown files --
# README, CONTRIBUTING, REVIEWING, SECURITY, RELEASE_NOTES and CHANGELOG
# -- each pulled into a *_link.md shim by a myst {include}. The
# shims are what the code below reads, so adding one needs no edit here.
# Those files are written for the places that read them unrendered: the
# GitHub file view and, for README.md, the PyPI long description. So a
# root file links another as "./SECURITY.md", the spelling links.yml
# checks, resolving it as a path relative to the file. Sphinx sees them
# lifted out of the tree that makes it correct, and myst resolves not one
# of those links. README.md links it as BLOB plus its path, PyPI
# resolving no relative link against the tree (section 2 of the
# organization's standard), and myst renders that as a link to GitHub.
#
# What myst emits for a relative link is the reason this needs code
# rather than a warning filter: a target myst cannot resolve becomes an
# anchor on the page it is already on, href="#./SECURITY.md", an id
# nothing has. The build succeeds, -W sees nothing, and lychee reads the
# sources, where the path is right.
#
# The transform below answers each link from the repository rather than
# from a table that would have to be kept in step with this directory: a
# path a *_link.md shim includes becomes a reference to that page,
# whether written relative or as BLOB plus the path; any other relative
# path that exists in the tree becomes a link to the file on GitHub, and
# a relative path that exists nowhere is left to myst -- which reports
# it, and -W then fails, no suppress_warnings hiding the subtype.
#
# It also reads a link written this way *outside* a shim, resolved
# against the document that wrote it rather than against ROOT. A page
# under docs/source is itself read unrendered on the forge, so a link
# composed relative to its own file -- "../../README.md#installing",
# climbing out of docs/source the way a checkout resolves it -- works
# there verbatim, and this is what lets the same link resolve here too,
# through the shim page that carries the heading once the {include} has
# run.
#
# Not the {include} directive's :relative-docs: option, which is what it
# looks like the job of. It rewrites destinations that begin with the
# prefix it is given, so "docs/source/" leaves "./SECURITY.md" untouched;
# and giving it "./" is worse than doing nothing, measured -- the
# destination becomes "../../SECURITY.md", a path outside srcdir that is
# no document, sphinx reads it as a download, finds nothing to copy, and
# renders the link text with no link at all.
#
# Not copying the root files into this directory at build time either.
# README.md links to LICENSE, which is not part of the documentation --
# no shim includes it, which is what decides it -- so copies leave that
# link dead however many are made; and the copies are generated files in
# a source tree, which is a second definition of files that already
# exist.

# a shim is one myst include fence, and everything after the directive
# name on that line is the directive's argument: the path of the file the
# shim renders, spaces included. Options are the lines under it, never
# this one, so the path ends where the line does
