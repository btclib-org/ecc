# furo: content first, the navigation in the left sidebar and the page's
# own contents in the right, light and dark from one setting -- the shape
# a reference generated from docstrings has. Section 2 of the
# organization's standard is where it was weighed against shibuya, whose
# landing pages and announcement bars are surface this tree would carry
# and not use; sphinx_rtd_theme is where a Read the Docs project starts by
# default, which is a reason to find it in a tree rather than to keep it
html_theme = "furo"

# no html_static_path: this project overrides no stylesheet and ships no
# image, so the "_static" the sphinx template declares names a directory
# that does not exist, and sphinx warns about it on every build, which -W
# turns into a failure. The setting arrives with the directory, not before
# it


# -- Links out of the included root markdown files ----------------------------

# Some pages of the toctree are this repository's root markdown files,
# each pulled into a *_link.md shim by a myst {include}. The code below
# reads the include of every docs/source/*.md page, so adding a shim needs
# no edit here. Those files are written for the places that read them
# unrendered: the GitHub file view and, for README.md, the PyPI long
# description. So a root file links another as "./SECURITY.md", the
# spelling links.yml checks, resolving it as a path relative to the file.
# Sphinx sees them lifted out of the tree that makes it correct, and myst
# resolves not one of those links. README.md links it as BLOB plus its
# path, PyPI resolving no relative link against the tree (section 2 of the
# organization's standard), and myst renders that as a link to GitHub.
#
# What myst emits for a relative link is the reason this needs code
# rather than a warning filter: a target myst cannot resolve becomes an
# anchor on the page it is already on, href="#./SECURITY.md", an id
# nothing has. The build succeeds, -W sees nothing, and lychee reads the
# sources, where the path is right.
#
# The transform below answers each link from the repository rather than
# from a table that would have to be kept in step with this directory: a
# path a page of docs/source includes, or a page of docs/source itself,
# becomes a reference to that page, whether written relative or as BLOB
# plus the path; any other relative path that exists in the tree becomes
# a link to the file on GitHub, and a relative path that exists nowhere
# is left to myst -- which reports it, and -W then fails, no
# suppress_warnings hiding the subtype.
#
# It also reads a link written this way on a page that includes no file,
# resolved against the document that wrote it. A page under docs/source
# is itself read unrendered on the forge, so a link composed relative to
# its own file -- "../../README.md#installing", climbing out of
# docs/source the way a checkout resolves it -- works there verbatim,
# and this is what lets the same link resolve here too, through the shim
# page that carries the heading once the {include} has run.
#
# Not the {include} directive's :relative-docs: option, which is what it
# looks like the job of. It rewrites destinations that begin with the
# prefix it is given, so "docs/source/" leaves "./SECURITY.md" untouched;
# and giving it "./" is worse than doing nothing, measured -- the
# destination becomes "../../SECURITY.md", a path outside srcdir that is
# no document, sphinx reads it as a download, finds nothing to copy, and
# renders the link text with no link at all.
#
# Not copying the root files into this directory at build time either.
# README.md links to LICENSE, which is not part of the documentation --
# no page includes it, which is what decides it -- so copies leave that
# link dead however many are made; and the copies are generated files in
# a source tree, which is a second definition of files that already
# exist.
